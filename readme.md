> Yet another job queue with tags and scheduled jobs

This is implementation of job queue with MongoDB. As like other attempts it utilizes atomic writes to grab jobs, but with much more simple API to use it:

## Usage

```js
var queue = require('yajob')('localhost/queuedb');

var mails = queue.tag('mail');

yield mails.put({
    from: 'floatdrop@yandex-team.ru',
    to: 'nodejs-dev@yandex-team.ru',
    body: 'Wow!'
});

var jobs = yield mails.take(100);

for (var mail of jobs) {
    yield sendmail(mail);
}
```

Job considered `done`, when `next` method on iterator from `take` is called.

### Skipping jobs

In some cases you will need to skip taken job. To do this pass into generator `false` value:

```js
var jobs = yield mails.take(100);
var job = jobs.next().value;
if (value === 'Ohnoez') {
    job.next(false); // Returning Ohnoez to queue and get next job
}
```

### Prioritizing jobs

By default, all jobs have priority `0`. You can specify `sort` for queue, in which jobs will be taken:

```js
var important = queue.tag('mail').sort({priority: -1});
var trash = queue.tag('mail').sort({priority: 1});
```

## API

### Yajob(uri)

Returns instance of queue, that stores data in MongoDB.

####â„– uri  
Type: `String`  

MongoDB URI string.

## Methods

### put(attrs, [options])

Add job to queue. Returns `Promise`.

##### options
Type: `Object`

 * `schedule` - `Date`, when job should be available to `take`
 * `priority` - `Number`, that represents priority of job

### take([count])

Returns `Promise` that resolves to a `Generator`, that will emit jobs one by one.

After every `next` previous job considered done.

##### count
Type: `Number`  
Default: `1`

Maximum number of jobs to take from one batch request.

### remove(attrs)

Removes jobs, that match `attrs` from queue. Returns `Promise`.

### tag(name)
Default: `default`

Sets `name` of the MongoDB collection, that will be used to save and get jobs.

### delay(milliseconds)

Sets delay for job, that is not scheduled. That is - every job without `schedule` options will be scheduled on `Date() + delay`.

### trys(number)
Default: `Infinity`

Sets maximum job trys, before `failed` status will be assigned.

### close()

Closes connections to MongoDB.
